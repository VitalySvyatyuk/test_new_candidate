# test_new_candidate

Task 1
There are errors (syntax and logic) in tasks.py.
Please find and fix them.
It's okay if you don't find them all, just find as many as you can.

Task 2
We can get a list of users by link '/users/' from views.UsersViewSet.
The code is working well, but we would like to decrease queries to db.
Update UsersViewSet to decrease db queries for GET request to '/users/' .


Send fixed tasks.py and views.py to vitaly.svyatyuk@forwardview.eu
Please don't create forks.
